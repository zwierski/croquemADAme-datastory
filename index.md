# Abstract
Nowadays, anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection can become a YouTuber. Many beginners dream of success on the platform, with videos acclaimed by millions of subscribers. However, reaching fame is not as easy as it seems: indeed, with how much the number of creators has grown in the past years, it has become increasingly difficult to make an impact. The difference between famous and unknown YouTubers may lie in more than the quality of their videos. Are there any metrics in famous YouTubers' most viral videos - title, length, category, upload date - that set them apart from the rest? Could these metrics be used to create a guide for YouTubers who are starting out?

Let's look at the example of Ada Westerlain. Ada is an amateur video maker who enjoys filming small vlogs and sharing them with her friends. Lately, she started thinking about gathering a larger audience: and what better way to do so than post her videos on YouTube? It'll definitely give her work a lot of exposure! Ada is a bit intimidated, however. With so many entertainers on the platform, how is she going to stand out? Nevertheless, Ada creates and posts her first video: "day in my life at university".

# Preprocessing - What data will we analyse?

Let's step away from Ada's story to look at our dataset. We would like to know, in general, how entertainment channels fare with regards to buzzing videos. This raises another question: how to determine whether a channel is successful, or whether a video is a buzz or a flop?

# After the first video

It's been a difficult time for Ada. After posting her first vlog on her YouTube channel, she awaited the views, the likes and the comments. Yet, even weeks after the video was posted, it barely got around 10 views. Ada doesn't understand why her video flopped so badly: she chose a popular topic she was interested in, filmed the video with quality material, and worked hard on the editing too! What could be missing?
