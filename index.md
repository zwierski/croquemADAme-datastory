# Abstract
Nowadays, anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection can become a YouTuber. Many beginners dream of success on the platform, with videos acclaimed by millions of subscribers. However, reaching fame is not as easy as it seems: indeed, with how much the number of creators has grown in the past years, it has become increasingly difficult to make an impact. The difference between famous and unknown YouTubers may lie in more than the quality of their videos. Are there any metrics in famous YouTubers' most viral videos - title, length, category, upload date - that set them apart from the rest? Could these metrics be used to create a guide for YouTubers who are starting out?
